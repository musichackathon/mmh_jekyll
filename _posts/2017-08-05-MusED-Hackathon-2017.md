The [MusED Hackathon]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _events/2017-08-05.md %}), held on August 5, revolved around Music Education, Music Experience Design, and musing about and muses for Music. It was held in collaboration with the [IMPACT Conference](https://impact.musedlab.org/) and NYU Steinhardt's [MusEDLab](https://musedlab.org/) lab.

After kicking off the day with a set of invigorating talks at 12 pm and a pizza break before 2 pm, participants took part in workshops or gathered in groups and created hacks.

Kushagra Sharma, Manaswi Mishra, and Siddharth Bhardwaj, visiting us from [Music Hackathons Bulgaria](https://www.facebook.com/MusicHackathonsBG/) kicked off the presentations with the project that brough them to NY, Samsara. They presented that, as well as the project they worked on at the hackathon, and were followed by Todd Gregory, Derek Bioh, Liam Baum, Patrick S. Lee, Adam November, Cole Mahlowitz, Jonathan Marmor, Antony Fonville, Tasdique, Sammy, Omar, and Aman. The projects ranged from apps (using music and visualizations and in support of performing artists), to cardboard and aluminum instruments, to a physical version of a beat generation app, to a musical composition created from a video recording.
